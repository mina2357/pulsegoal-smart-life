## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not open an issue directly**.

Instead, contact me privately at:

📧 **mina.dev.secure@protonmail.com**  
(أو استبدله ببريدك الحقيقي لو عندك واحد مخصص للأمان)

Please include as much detail as possible, including reproduction steps.

We take security seriously and will respond as quickly as possible.
